This is a Java MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Quiz application developed using Java Swing, AWT, and object-oriented programming concepts. The application allows users to participate in a quiz by answering a set of 10 multiple-choice questions. Here is a detailed description of the project:

1. Login Page:
   - The application starts with a login page where users enter their credentials.
   - The entered credentials are verified and validated to ensure proper authentication.
   - If the login is successful, the user is granted access to the quiz.

3. Quiz Questions:
   - The quiz consists of 10 questions, each having four options.
   - The user is presented with the questions one by one.
   - A timer is set for each question, and once the time limit for a question is over, the user is automatically moved to the next question.

4. Answering Questions:
   - For each question, the user selects the correct option by choosing the corresponding radio button.
   - If the user selects the correct option, they receive a score of +10 for that question; otherwise, they receive a score of 0.

5. Navigation Buttons:
   - The user can move to the next question by clicking the "Next" button.
